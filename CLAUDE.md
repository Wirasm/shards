# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Principles

**Target User:** Power users and agentic-forward engineers who want speed, control, and isolation. Users who run multiple AI agents simultaneously and need clean environment separation.

**Single-Developer Tool:** No multi-tenant complexity. Optimize for the solo developer managing parallel AI workflows.

**Type Safety (CRITICAL):** Rust's type system is a feature, not an obstacle. Use it fully.

## Codebase Realities

These facts should drive every design decision:

**Trait + factory architecture is the stability backbone.** Extension points are intentionally explicit and swappable. Most features should be added via trait implementation + factory registration, not cross-cutting rewrites.

**Performance and binary size are product goals, not nice-to-have.** Cargo.toml release profile and dependency choices optimize for size and determinism. Convenience dependencies and broad abstractions can silently regress these goals.

## Engineering Principles

These are mandatory implementation constraints, not slogans.

**KISS** — Prefer straightforward control flow over clever meta-programming. Prefer explicit match branches and typed structs over hidden dynamic behavior. Keep error paths obvious and localized.

**YAGNI** — Do not add new config keys, trait methods, feature flags, or workflow branches without a concrete accepted use case. Do not introduce speculative abstractions without at least one current caller. Keep unsupported paths explicit (error out) rather than adding partial fake support.

**DRY + Rule of Three** — Duplicate small, local logic when it preserves clarity. Extract shared utilities only after repeated, stable patterns (rule of three). When extracting, preserve module boundaries and avoid hidden coupling.

**SRP + ISP** — Keep each module focused on one concern. Extend behavior by implementing existing narrow traits whenever possible. Avoid fat interfaces and "god modules" that mix policy + transport + storage.

**Fail Fast + Explicit Errors** — Prefer explicit `bail!`/errors for unsupported or unsafe states. Never silently broaden permissions or capabilities. Document fallback behavior when fallback is intentional and safe.

**Determinism + Reproducibility** — Prefer reproducible commands and locked dependency behavior in CI-sensitive paths. Keep tests deterministic (no flaky timing/network dependence without guardrails). Ensure local validation commands map to CI expectations.

**Reversibility + Rollback-First** — Keep changes easy to revert (small scope, clear blast radius). For risky changes, define rollback path before merge. Avoid mixed mega-patches that block safe rollback.

## Git as First-Class Citizen

KILD is built around git worktrees. Let git handle what git does best:

- **Surface git errors to users** for actionable issues (conflicts, uncommitted changes, branch already exists)
- **Handle expected failures gracefully** (missing directories during cleanup, worktree already removed)
- **Trust git's natural guardrails** (e.g., git2 refuses to remove worktree with uncommitted changes - surface this, don't bypass it)
- **Branch naming:** KILD creates `kild/<branch>` branches automatically for isolation using git-native namespacing. The worktree admin name (`kild-<branch>`) is filesystem-safe and decoupled from the branch name via `WorktreeAddOptions::reference()`

## Code Quality Standards

All PRs must pass before merge:

```bash
cargo fmt --check              # Formatting (0 violations)
cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings  # Linting (0 warnings, enforced via -D)
cargo test --all               # All tests pass
cargo build --all              # Clean build
```

**Tooling:**

- `cargo fmt` - Rustfmt with default settings
- `cargo clippy` - Strict linting, warnings treated as errors
- `thiserror` - For error type definitions
- `tracing` - For structured logging (JSON output)

## Architecture

**Workspace structure:**

- `crates/kild-paths` - Centralized path construction for ~/.kild/ directory layout (KildPaths struct with typed methods for all paths). Single source of truth for KILD filesystem layout.
- `crates/kild-config` - TOML configuration types, loading, validation, and keybindings for ~/.kild/config.toml. Depends only on kild-paths and kild-protocol. Single source of truth for all KildConfig/Config/Keybindings types. Extracted from kild-core to enable fast incremental compilation of config-only changes.
- `crates/kild-protocol` - Shared IPC protocol types (ClientMessage, DaemonMessage, SessionInfo, SessionStatus, ErrorCode), domain newtypes (SessionId, BranchName, ProjectId), and serde-only domain enums (ForgeType). Also provides `IpcConnection` for JSONL-over-Unix-socket client used by both kild-core and kild-tmux-shim with connection health checking via `is_alive()`, and `AsyncIpcClient<R, W>` — a generic async JSONL client over any `AsyncBufRead + AsyncWrite` pair used by kild-ui. All public enums are `#[non_exhaustive]` for forward compatibility. Newtypes defined via `newtype_string!` macro for compile-time type safety. Deps: serde, serde_json, futures (tempfile, smol for tests). No tokio, no kild-core. Single source of truth for daemon wire format and IPC client.
- `crates/kild-core` - Core library with all business logic, no CLI dependencies
- `crates/kild` - Thin CLI that consumes kild-core (clap for arg parsing, color.rs for Tallinn Night palette output)
- `crates/kild-daemon` - Standalone daemon binary for PTY management (async tokio server, JSONL IPC protocol, portable-pty integration). CLI spawns this as subprocess. Wire types re-exported from kild-protocol.
- `crates/kild-tmux-shim` - tmux-compatible shim binary for agent team support (CLI that intercepts tmux commands, routes to daemon IPC via kild-protocol::IpcConnection)
- `crates/kild-teams` - Agent team discovery and state management library. Reads shim pane registries at `~/.kild/shim/` to enumerate leader + teammate panes and resolve their daemon session IDs. Used by CLI (`kild teammates`) and kild-ui (sidebar badge).
- `crates/kild-ui` - GPUI-based native GUI with multi-project support
- `crates/kild-peek-core` - Core library for native app inspection and interaction (window listing, screenshots, image comparison, assertions, UI automation)
- `crates/kild-peek` - CLI for visual verification of native macOS applications

- `commands/` - Command implementations (assert.rs, diff.rs, elements.rs, interact.rs, list.rs, screenshot.rs, window_resolution.rs)
- `main.rs` - CLI entry point

**Module pattern:** Each domain in kild-core starts with `errors.rs`, `types/`, `mod.rs`. Core types and submodules may be organized as directories (e.g., `sessions/types/` contains agent_process.rs, request.rs, safety.rs, session.rs, status.rs, tests.rs; `sessions/persistence/` contains patching.rs, session_files.rs, sidecar.rs, tests.rs). Additional files vary by domain (e.g., `create.rs`/`open.rs`/`stop.rs`/`list.rs`/`destroy.rs`/`complete.rs`/`agent_status.rs`/`daemon_helpers.rs` for sessions with `handler.rs` as re-export facade). kild-daemon uses a flatter structure with top-level errors/types and module-specific implementation files. kild-tmux-shim, kild (CLI), and kild-peek (CLI) use focused modules organized by domain (parser/, app/, commands/).

**CLI interaction:** Commands delegate directly to `kild-core` handlers. No business logic in CLI layer.

**Command pattern:** Business operations are defined as `Command` enum variants in `kild-core/state/types.rs`. The `Store` trait in `kild-core/state/store.rs` provides the dispatch contract, returning `Vec<Event>` on success to describe state changes. The `Event` enum in `kild-core/state/events.rs` defines all business state changes (kild lifecycle, project management).

**Dispatch vs direct-call guidance:**

- **UI state-mutating operations**: Always dispatch through Store. All operations use `Command` → `CoreStore::dispatch` → `Event` → `apply_events`. This ensures consistent event-driven state updates.
- **CLI operations**: Call handler functions directly (e.g., `session_ops::create_session`). The CLI is synchronous and doesn't need event-driven updates.
- **Read-only queries**: Call handler functions directly from both CLI and UI. Queries like `list_sessions`, `get_session`, `get_destroy_safety_info` don't mutate state and don't need dispatch.

## Code Style Preferences

**Prefer string literals over enums for event names.** Event names are typed as string literals directly in the tracing macros, not as enum variants. This keeps logging flexible and greppable.

**Use newtypes for domain identifiers.** Session IDs, branch names, and project IDs use the `newtype_string!` macro pattern for compile-time type safety. See `kild-protocol/src/types.rs` for the macro and existing newtypes. This prevents mixing up identifiers at the type level.

**No backward-compatibility shims.** When renaming or moving types, rename all usages. Never introduce type aliases, re-exports, or wrapper types solely for backward compatibility. This is a single-developer tool with no external consumers — there is nobody to keep compatible with. One name, one type, everywhere.

**No `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` in production code.** Always propagate errors with `?` or handle them explicitly. Panicking crashes the process — use `Result` for all fallible operations.

**Don't clone to satisfy the borrow checker.** If the borrow checker complains, understand the ownership issue first. Restructure borrows, use `mem::take`, or redesign the data flow. Cloning `Rc`/`Arc` is fine — that's their purpose.

**Prefer borrowed types for function arguments.** Use `&str` over `&String`, `&[T]` over `&Vec<T>`, `&Path` over `&PathBuf`. This accepts more input types via deref coercion and avoids unnecessary indirection.

## Structured Logging

### Setup

Logging is initialized via `kild_core::init_logging(quiet)` in the CLI main.rs. Output is JSON format via tracing-subscriber.

By default, all log output is suppressed (clean output). When `-v/--verbose` flag is used, info-level and above events are emitted.

The `-v/--verbose` flag is required to see any logs. The `RUST_LOG` env var alone will not override the default quiet mode.

Enable verbose logs with the verbose flag: `cargo run -- -v list`

### Event Naming Convention

All events follow: `{layer}.{domain}.{action}_{state}`

| Layer       | Crate                    | Description                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `cli`       | `crates/kild/`           | User-facing CLI commands         |
| `core`      | `crates/kild-core/`      | Core library logic               |
| `daemon`    | `crates/kild-daemon/`    | Daemon server and PTY management |
| `shim`      | `crates/kild-tmux-shim/` | tmux shim binary operations      |
| `ui`        | `crates/kild-ui/`        | GPUI native GUI                  |
| `peek.cli`  | `crates/kild-peek/`      | kild-peek CLI commands           |
| `peek.core` | `crates/kild-peek-core/` | kild-peek core library           |

**Domains:** `session`, `terminal`, `daemon`, `git`, `forge`, `cleanup`, `health`, `files`, `process`, `pid_file`, `app`, `projects`, `state`, `notify`, `watcher`, `teams`, `discovery`, `window`, `screenshot`, `diff`, `assert`, `interact`, `element`, `pty`, `protocol`, `split_window`, `send_keys`, `list_panes`, `kill_pane`, `display_message`, `select_pane`, `set_option`, `select_layout`, `resize_pane`, `has_session`, `new_session`, `new_window`, `list_windows`, `break_pane`, `join_pane`, `capture_pane`, `ipc`

UI-specific domains: `terminal` (for kild-ui terminal rendering), `input` (for keystroke translation)

Note: `projects` domain events are `core.projects.*` (in kild-core), while UI-specific events use `ui.*` prefix.

Note: `core.daemon.*` = daemon client IPC and auto-start (in kild-core), `daemon.*` = daemon server/PTY operations (in kild-daemon).

Daemon server sub-domains: `session`, `pty`, `server`, `connection`, `client`, `pid`, `config`

**State suffixes:** `_started`, `_completed`, `_failed`, `_skipped`

### Logging Principles

Every log event must include a structured `event` field following `{layer}.{domain}.{action}_{state}`. The event name alone should identify what happened and where — no prose message needed for normal operations.

Emit `_started` and `_completed` pairs for every user-visible operation so log triage can measure duration and detect hangs. Emit `_failed` on any error path with the error attached. Skip `_started` only for trivially fast, non-blocking reads.

Use `%e` (Display) for error values, `?val` (Debug) for complex types like enums and structs. Never log raw `{:?}` without the field name — always name your fields.

Each layer logs only its own concern. CLI logs intent and outcome; core logs domain logic; daemon logs PTY and server events; shim logs IPC calls. Do not log across layer boundaries.

```rust
info!(event = "cli.create_started", branch = branch, agent = config.agent.default);
error!(event = "cli.create_failed", error = %e);
info!(event = "core.git.worktree.create_completed", path = %worktree_path.display());
info!(event = "core.forge.pr_info_fetch_completed", pr_number = pr.number, state = ?pr.state);
```

### App Lifecycle Events

Use helpers from `kild_core::events`:

```rust
use kild_core::events;

events::log_app_startup();           // core.app.startup_completed
events::log_app_shutdown();          // core.app.shutdown_started
events::log_app_error(&error);       // core.app.error_occurred
```

### Log Level Guidelines

| Level    | Usage                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `error!` | Operation failed, requires attention                               |
| `warn!`  | Degraded operation, fallback used, non-critical issues             |
| `info!`  | Operation lifecycle (\_started, \_completed), user-relevant events |
| `debug!` | Internal state, retry attempts, detailed flow                      |

### Filtering Logs

Filter by layer prefix or domain substring — the event name encodes both:

```bash
grep 'event":"core\.'     # all core events
grep 'core\.session\.'    # session domain
grep 'event":"daemon\.'   # daemon server events
grep '_failed"'           # all failures across all layers
```

## Terminal Backend Pattern

```rust
pub trait TerminalBackend: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn is_available(&self) -> bool;
    fn execute_spawn(&self, config: &SpawnConfig, window_title: Option<&str>)
        -> Result<Option<String>, TerminalError>;
    fn focus_window(&self, window_id: Option<&str>) -> Result<(), TerminalError>;
    fn hide_window(&self, window_id: &str) -> Result<(), TerminalError>;
    fn close_window(&self, window_id: Option<&str>);
    fn is_window_open(&self, window_id: &str) -> Result<Option<bool>, TerminalError>;
}
```

Backends registered in `terminal/registry.rs`. Detection preference varies by platform:

- macOS: Ghostty > iTerm > Terminal.app
- Linux: Alacritty (requires Hyprland window manager)

Status detection uses PID tracking by default. Ghostty uses window-based detection as fallback when PID is unavailable. Alacritty on Linux uses Hyprland IPC for window management.

## tmux Shim for Agent Teams

**Purpose:** Makes Claude Code agent teams work transparently inside daemon-managed kild sessions.

**How it works:**

1. `kild create --daemon` sets `$TMUX` + `$TMUX_PANE` + prepends `~/.kild/bin` to `$PATH` in the PTY environment
2. Claude Code detects `$TMUX` and uses tmux pane backend for agent teams
3. `kild-core` symlinks `kild-tmux-shim` binary as `~/.kild/bin/tmux` during first daemon session creation
4. When Claude Code calls `tmux split-window`, `tmux send-keys`, etc., those calls hit the shim
5. Shim creates new daemon PTYs for teammates via IPC, manages pane state locally in `~/.kild/shim/<session>/`
6. `kild destroy` automatically cleans up all child shim PTYs

**Supported tmux commands:** `split-window` (creates daemon PTYs), `send-keys` (writes to PTY stdin with key name translation), `kill-pane` (destroys PTYs), `display-message` (expands format strings), `list-panes`, `select-pane`, `set-option`, `select-layout` (no-op), `resize-pane` (no-op), `has-session`, `new-session`, `new-window`, `list-windows`, `break-pane`, `join-pane`, `capture-pane` (reads PTY scrollback with `-p` for print, `-S` for start line).

**State management:** File-based pane registry at `~/.kild/shim/<session_id>/panes.json` with flock-based concurrency control. Each pane maps to a daemon session ID.

**Environment variables:**

- `$TMUX` - Set by kild-core, triggers Claude Code's tmux backend
- `$TMUX_PANE` - Current pane ID (e.g., `%0` for leader, `%1`, `%2` for teammates)
- `$KILD_SHIM_SESSION` - Session ID for shim state lookup
- `$KILD_SHIM_LOG` - Enable shim logging (file path or `1` for `~/.kild/shim/<session>/shim.log`)
- `$KILD_SESSION_BRANCH` - Branch name for Claude Code and Codex notify hook status reporting (fallback when `--self` PWD detection unavailable)

**Integration points in kild-core:**

- `daemon_helpers.rs:ensure_shim_binary()` - Symlinks shim as `~/.kild/bin/tmux` (best-effort, warns on failure)
- `daemon_helpers.rs:ensure_codex_notify_hook()` - Installs `~/.kild/hooks/codex-notify` for Codex CLI integration (idempotent, best-effort)
- `daemon_helpers.rs:ensure_codex_config()` - Patches `~/.codex/config.toml` with notify hook (respects existing config, best-effort)
- `daemon_helpers.rs:ensure_claude_status_hook()` - Installs `~/.kild/hooks/claude-status` for Claude Code integration (idempotent, best-effort)
- `daemon_helpers.rs:ensure_claude_settings()` - Patches `~/.claude/settings.json` with hook entries (respects existing config, best-effort)
- `daemon_helpers.rs:build_daemon_create_request()` - Injects shim, Codex, and Claude Code env vars into daemon PTY requests
- `create.rs:create_session()` - Initializes shim state directory, `panes.json`, and agent-specific hooks for daemon sessions
- `open.rs:open_session()` - Ensures agent-specific hooks when opening sessions
- `destroy.rs:destroy_session()` - Destroys child shim PTYs and UI-created daemon sessions via daemon IPC, removes `~/.kild/shim/<session>/`, and cleans up task lists at `~/.claude/tasks/<task_list_id>/`

## Agent Hook Integration

### Claude Code Status Hook Integration

**Purpose:** Auto-configures Claude Code to report agent activity states (idle/waiting) back to KILD via `agent-status` command.

**How it works:**

1. `kild create/open --agent claude` installs `~/.kild/hooks/claude-status` shell script
2. Script is patched into `~/.claude/settings.json` for Stop, Notification, SubagentStop, TeammateIdle, and TaskCompleted hook events
3. Claude Code calls the hook with JSON events on stdin
4. Hook maps events to KILD statuses: Stop/SubagentStop/TeammateIdle/TaskCompleted → idle, Notification(permission_prompt) → waiting, Notification(idle_prompt) → idle
5. Hook calls `kild agent-status --self <status> --notify` to update session state and send desktop notifications

**Hook script:** `~/.kild/hooks/claude-status` (shell script, auto-generated, do not edit)

**Settings patching behavior:**

- Idempotent: runs on every `create/open --agent claude` but only patches if needed
- Respects existing user hooks: if any hook event already references the claude-status script, skips patching
- Creates `~/.claude/settings.json` if missing
- Preserves all existing settings and hooks

**Environment variables:**

- `$KILD_SESSION_BRANCH` - Injected into Claude Code sessions as fallback for `--self` PWD-based detection

**Manual setup:** Run `kild init-hooks claude` to install hook and patch settings without creating a session.

**Best-effort pattern:** All operations warn on failure but never block session creation. If hook install or settings patch fails, user sees warnings with manual remediation steps.

### Codex Notify Hook Integration

**Purpose:** Auto-configures Codex CLI to report agent activity states (idle/waiting) back to KILD via `agent-status` command.

**How it works:**

1. `kild create/open --agent codex` installs `~/.kild/hooks/codex-notify` shell script
2. Script is patched into `~/.codex/config.toml` as `notify = ["<path>"]`
3. Codex CLI calls the hook with JSON events on stdin (`agent-turn-complete`, `approval-requested`)
4. Hook maps events to KILD statuses: `agent-turn-complete` → idle, `approval-requested` → waiting
5. Hook calls `kild agent-status --self <status> --notify` to update session state and send desktop notifications

**Hook script:** `~/.kild/hooks/codex-notify` (shell script, auto-generated, do not edit)

**Config patching behavior:**

- Idempotent: runs on every `create/open --agent codex` but only patches if needed
- Respects existing user config: if `notify = [...]` is already set with a non-empty array, no changes are made
- Creates `~/.codex/config.toml` if missing
- Appends notify line if config exists but has missing or empty notify field

**Environment variables:**

- `$KILD_SESSION_BRANCH` - Injected into Codex sessions as fallback for `--self` PWD-based detection

## Forge Backend Pattern

```rust
pub trait ForgeBackend: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn display_name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn is_available(&self) -> bool;
    fn is_pr_merged(&self, worktree_path: &Path, branch: &str) -> bool;
    fn check_pr_exists(&self, worktree_path: &Path, branch: &str) -> PrCheckResult;
    fn fetch_pr_info(&self, worktree_path: &Path, branch: &str) -> Option<PrInfo>;
}
```

Backends registered in `forge/registry.rs`. Forge detection via `detect_forge()` inspects git remote URL. Currently supports:

- GitHub (via `gh` CLI)
- Future: GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea

Override auto-detection with `[git] forge = "github"` in config. PR types (PrInfo, PrState, CiStatus, ReviewStatus) defined in `forge/types.rs`.

## Configuration Hierarchy

Priority (highest wins): CLI args → project config (`./.kild/config.toml`) → user config (`~/.kild/config.toml`) → defaults

**All config options are documented in `.kild/config.example.toml`.** Load the `/kild` skill for help with config changes.

**Keybindings** use a separate file: project (`./.kild/keybindings.toml`) overrides user (`~/.kild/keybindings.toml`). Invalid bindings warn and fall back to defaults — never block startup. See `crates/kild-config/src/keybindings.rs` for the full schema.

**Array Merging:** `include_patterns.patterns` arrays are merged (deduplicated) from user and project configs. Other config values follow standard override behavior.

**Runtime mode resolution:** Sessions run in either daemon-owned PTYs or external terminals. Resolution order for both `create` and `open`: `--daemon`/`--no-daemon` flag → session's stored `runtime_mode` (open only) → config `daemon.enabled` → default (terminal). All sessions store their `runtime_mode` in the session file. Daemon sessions auto-open an attach window; use `kild attach <branch>` to reconnect.

**Agent teams:** Daemon sessions inject `$TMUX` and configure the tmux shim (see "tmux Shim for Agent Teams" section) to enable Claude Code agent teams without external tmux.

**UI keyboard shortcuts:**
All UI shortcuts are configurable via `~/.kild/keybindings.toml` (user) or `./.kild/keybindings.toml` (project). See `crates/kild-config/src/keybindings.rs` for all available keys and defaults.

## Error Handling

All domain errors implement `KildError` trait with `error_code()` and `is_user_error()`. Use `thiserror` for definitions.
