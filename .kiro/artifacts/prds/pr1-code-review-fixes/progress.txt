# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-12
Feature: pr1-code-review-fixes

## Codebase Patterns
- Add patterns as discovered

## Key Files
- src/git/handler.rs - Git worktree operations
- src/sessions/operations.rs - Session persistence logic
- src/sessions/handler.rs - Session orchestration
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-001
- Implemented warning log for state inconsistency in remove_worktree_by_path
- Files changed: src/git/handler.rs
- **Learnings:**
  - Added warn import to tracing module
  - Silent failures in cleanup operations can hide important state inconsistencies
  - Proper logging helps users understand when system state is inconsistent
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-002
- Modified load_sessions_from_files to return tuple with skipped count
- Updated list_sessions to log warning when sessions are skipped
- Files changed: src/sessions/operations.rs, src/sessions/handler.rs
- **Learnings:**
  - Returning structured data (tuples) allows callers to handle error counts
  - User-facing operations should provide feedback about partial failures
  - Test updates needed when changing function signatures
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-003
- Added comprehensive tests for atomic write pattern in save_session_to_file
- Tests verify temp file cleanup and atomic behavior
- Files changed: src/sessions/operations.rs
- **Learnings:**
  - Atomic write patterns need specific tests for temp file cleanup
  - Testing atomic behavior requires verifying no partial writes occur
  - Test isolation important when dealing with filesystem operations
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-004
- Added temp file cleanup on atomic write failure in save_session_to_file
- Enhanced error handling to clean up orphaned temp files
- Files changed: src/sessions/operations.rs
- **Learnings:**
  - Atomic operations need cleanup on all failure paths
  - Using explicit error handling instead of ? operator allows cleanup
  - Testing failure scenarios requires creating specific failure conditions
