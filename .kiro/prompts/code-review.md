# Comprehensive Code Review

## First Step: Get Review Scope

Ask the user: "What would you like to review? Options: PR number (e.g., '123'), 'diff' for current unstaged changes, 'staged' for staged changes, or 'branch' for current branch vs main"

---

## Your Mission

Orchestrate a comprehensive code review by spawning specialized agents in parallel, then synthesizing their findings into a detailed, actionable report that enables informed decision-making.

---

## Phase 1: DETERMINE SCOPE

Based on user's response, determine the review scope:

| User Input | Scope Type | Command to Get Changes |
|------------|------------|------------------------|
| Number (e.g., `123`) | PR Review | `gh pr diff 123` and `gh pr view 123` |
| `diff` | Unstaged Changes | `git diff` |
| `staged` | Staged Changes | `git diff --staged` |
| `branch` | Branch vs Main | `git diff main...HEAD` |

**First, verify the scope exists:**

```bash
# For PR: Check PR exists and get context
gh pr view [number] --json title,state,body,author

# For diff/staged/branch: Check there are changes
git diff [options] --stat
```

**If no changes found, inform user and stop.**

---

## Phase 2: SPAWN REVIEW AGENTS IN PARALLEL

**CRITICAL: Spawn ALL applicable agents simultaneously using subagents.**

For each agent, provide clear instructions including:
1. The exact scope (PR number or diff command)
2. What to analyze
3. Expected output format with fix options

### Agents to Spawn

**Always spawn these 5 core agents in parallel:**

1. **code-reviewer** - General code quality and guidelines
   ```
   Review scope: [PR #{number} | current diff | staged changes | branch diff]

   Get changes with: [gh pr diff {number} | git diff | git diff --staged | git diff main...HEAD]

   Analyze the actual code changes for:
   - Project guidelines compliance
   - Bug detection (logic errors, null handling)
   - Code quality issues

   For each issue, provide:
   - Detailed explanation of WHY it's a problem
   - The IMPACT if left unfixed
   - 2-3 FIX OPTIONS with trade-offs for each

   Return findings with file:line references and confidence scores.
   ```

2. **comment-analyzer** - Documentation and comment quality
   ```
   Review scope: [PR #{number} | current diff | staged changes | branch diff]

   Get changes with: [command]

   Analyze comments and documentation in the actual changes for:
   - Factual accuracy vs code
   - Completeness and value
   - Misleading or outdated content

   For each issue, provide:
   - What's wrong and WHY it matters
   - 2-3 FIX OPTIONS (rewrite, remove, expand)

   Return findings with specific locations and suggestions.
   ```

3. **error-hunter** - Silent failures and error handling
   ```
   Review scope: [PR #{number} | current diff | staged changes | branch diff]

   Get changes with: [command]

   Hunt for error handling issues in the actual changes:
   - Silent failures and empty catch blocks
   - Inadequate error messages
   - Missing error logging
   - Overly broad exception catching

   For each issue, provide:
   - What errors could be hidden and their IMPACT
   - User experience consequences
   - 2-3 FIX OPTIONS with code examples

   Return findings with severity levels and fix suggestions.
   ```

4. **type-analyzer** - Type design and safety
   ```
   Review scope: [PR #{number} | current diff | staged changes | branch diff]

   Get changes with: [command]

   Analyze type definitions and usage in the actual changes:
   - Invariant strength and enforcement
   - Encapsulation quality
   - Type safety issues

   For each issue, provide:
   - WHY the current design is problematic
   - What bugs it could allow
   - 2-3 FIX OPTIONS with trade-offs

   Return ratings and specific improvement suggestions.
   ```

**Optionally spawn if relevant:**

5. **test-analyzer** - Test coverage (if test files are changed or new functionality added)
   ```
   Review scope: [PR #{number} | current diff | staged changes | branch diff]

   Get changes with: [command]

   Analyze test coverage for the actual changes:
   - Critical gaps in coverage
   - Test quality and maintainability
   - Missing edge cases

   For each gap, provide:
   - What could break without this test
   - Specific test cases to add
   - Priority (critical vs nice-to-have)

   Return prioritized test recommendations.
   ```

5. **doc-updater** - Documentation synchronization (ALWAYS SPAWN)
   ```
   Review scope: [PR #{number} | current diff | staged changes | branch diff]

   Get changes with: [command]

   Analyze code changes and check if documentation needs updates:
   - Read all steering docs (.kiro/steering/*.md)
   - Read .claude/skills/shards/SKILL.md
   - Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md (if they exist)
   - Compare code changes against documentation claims
   - Identify outdated information

   For each documentation update needed, provide:
   - Exact current text that's outdated
   - Exact proposed replacement text
   - Justification for the change
   - Priority (critical/important/minor)

   Return specific documentation updates with before/after text.
   ```

## Phase 3: WAIT AND COLLECT

Wait for all spawned agents to complete and collect their reports.

**Track progress:**
- [ ] code-reviewer complete
- [ ] comment-analyzer complete
- [ ] error-hunter complete
- [ ] type-analyzer complete
- [ ] doc-updater complete
- [ ] test-analyzer complete (if spawned)

---

## Phase 4: SYNTHESIZE DETAILED REPORT

Combine all agent findings into a comprehensive report. This SAME report will be:
1. Saved as an artifact
2. Posted to GitHub (for PR reviews)
3. Shown to the user

**IMPORTANT**: The report must be detailed enough for informed decision-making. Include full context, reasoning, and fix options for every issue.

## Phase 5: SAVE AND POST

### 5.1 Save Report

```bash
mkdir -p .kiro/artifacts/code-review-reports
```

Save the FULL report to: `.kiro/artifacts/code-review-reports/review-[scope]-[date].md`

### 5.2 Post to GitHub (PR reviews only)

**CRITICAL: Post the SAME full report to GitHub, not a summary.**

For PR reviews, post the complete report as a PR comment:

```bash
gh pr comment [number] --body "$(cat .kiro/artifacts/code-review-reports/review-PR-[number]-[date].md)"
```

This ensures the GitHub comment is identical to the saved artifact.

---

## Phase 6: OUTPUT TO USER

Show the user the same complete report (not a summary).

Then add:

```markdown
---

## Files

**Report saved**: `.kiro/artifacts/code-review-reports/review-[scope]-[date].md`
**GitHub**: [Posted full report to PR #X / N/A - not a PR review]

## Quick Reference

| Priority | Count | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Critical | X | Must fix before merge |
| Important | X | Should fix |
| Suggestions | X | Optional |

**Top 3 Actions**:
1. [Most important with location]
2. [Second with location]
3. [Third with location]
```

## Tips

- **Run early**: Review before creating PR, not after
- **Focus on critical**: Fix blocking issues first
- **Use fix options**: Each issue has multiple approaches - pick what fits your situation
- **Re-run after fixes**: Verify issues are resolved
- **Use for self-review**: Great for checking your own code before committing
