## Dependency Analysis

### Critical Dependency Chains

**Chain 1: Branch Handling Workflow**
```
#32 (Audit all prompts) → #29 (Fix specific prompts) → #33 (Add validation)
```
**Recommendation**: Address #32 first to establish proper branch handling patterns

**Chain 2: Health Monitoring System**
```
#26 (last_activity tracking) → #31 (enhanced monitoring)
```
**Recommendation**: Implement #26 to enable proper health monitoring

**Chain 3: Process Management**
```
#28 (process detection) → #27 (cleanup strategies)
```
**Recommendation**: Fix process detection before enhancing cleanup

### Circular Dependencies

None detected.
